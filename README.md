This game is called JetPackCat. It is my take on the now infamous game, Flappy Bird. With this take on Flappy Bird, I made the setting 
of the game to be at UIUC and the sprite (JetPackCat) is a student. Unlike before, the pipes will come crashing down, so be beware.
 

Run Game: 
- Install the latest version of cinder
- Build Cinder using the latest version of Clion using CMake
- Create a "my-projects" folder
- Drop/copy this application in the "my-projects folder"
- Make sure the working directory is set to this application 
- Compile and Run the game! 

To play:
- Press the space bar to jump 
- Press Enter to start the game
- The previous score and high score will be displayed the start of the game 

Rule: 
- The game ends when you hit: the sides of the pipe, the top and bottom screen.
- A point is awarded when the whole sprite completely passes the pipe.

Goal:
- Pass through as many pipes as you can!

To modify:
- In the constructor of pipe, the pipe's distance and width of the pipe can be adjusted. 

Disclaimer:
- All images used in the game are stored in the data folder.
