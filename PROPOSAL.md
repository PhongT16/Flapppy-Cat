For my final project, I'm wanting to recreate my own version of Flappy Bird. 
While the original game had one game mode, I want to add 2-3 game modes. Although, I don't 
have an exact idea of what game modes I want just yet.

I remember playing Flappy Bird a few years back, and I have always wanted 
to remake the game myself but never had the programming experience. 

My main concern is dealing with graphics and cinder. I have never dealt with graphics before and 
my knowledge of cinder is only to the extent of naivebayes and ideal-gas. So believe 
this project will allow me to develop in both of those programs.

By the end of week 1, I hope to have the basic logic of the game down.
Like getting the graphics to work and implementing the game controls.
By the end of week 2, I want the game to be done, with all the logic of the game 
implemented. It might be reach, but that's I hope for week 2. 
Week 3 would mostly be for improving the game and adding in additional features 
to the game. Maybe I can add on a few features to let the player customize 
the layout of the game.
